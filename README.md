# Hey Surrey Code Campers -- all of Surrey's codepen projects can be found in the GIST section.
#
# Codepen has a wonderul feature that allows you to export the codepen in the Gist section of our Github.
# Information how to do this: https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/features/exporting-pens/#export-gist
#
# As you work on your codepen you can also update the Gist.
# Information how this works: https://blog.codepen.io/2013/09/04/joy-gists-now-update/
